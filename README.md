# HeroSnail-OBJECTIVE The objective of the game is to control the snail and make it eat as many leaves as possible while avoiding obstacles.

        Press the "p" key to pause the game.
        Press the "m" key to mute/unmute the sound.
        As the snail moves forward, you need to make it go up or down to avoid the obstacles that appear in its path. If the snail hits an obstacle, it will lose a life. The game is over when the snail loses all of its lives.</p>
        To score points, the snail needs to eat leaves that appear on the screen. Each leaf eaten will add to the snail's score. The game will get progressively more difficult as the snail travels further, with obstacles becoming more frequent and appearing in more complex patterns.
        Pay attention to the upcoming obstacles so you can adjust the snail's position accordingly. Try to collect as many leaves as possible to increase your score. Take breaks when needed and use the pause feature if you need to step away from the game. Good luck and have fun playing the snail game!
